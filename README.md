## About Me

- ðŸŒ± My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC). I find the security field increasingly interesting and challenging daily, motivating me to learn and develop new skills. My strengths include verbal communication, adaptability, and a keen interest in investigating and exploring. My passion for protecting organizations and adhering to core ethical values provides me with a strong foundation for a career in cybersecurity.
